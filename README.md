# AutoPrompter

![video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64a3ae53-4708-4700-993a-71da0830a28b)

A free macOS teleprompter app that highlights your script in real-time as you speak. Built for streamers, interviewers, presenters, and podcasters.

AutoPrompter displays your text in a Dynamic Island-style overlay at the top of your screen, a draggable floating window, or fullscreen on a Sidecar iPad — visible only to you, invisible to your audience.

## Features

- **Word tracking** — highlights each word as you say it using on-device speech recognition or Deepgram
- **Classic mode** — constant-speed auto-scroll (no mic needed)
- **Voice-activated mode** — scrolls while you speak, pauses when you're silent
- **Browser overlay** — mirror the teleprompter to any browser on the local network
- **PowerPoint import** — drop a `.pptx` file to extract presenter notes as pages
- **Multi-page support** with automatic page advance
- **Tap to jump** — tap any word in the overlay to reposition the tracker
- **Completely private** — all processing happens on-device (no accounts, no tracking)

## Requirements

- macOS 15 Sequoia or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel
